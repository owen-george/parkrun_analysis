# Parkrun Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes parkrun data to provide insights into individual and event-level performance.
Using historical data, it builds machine learning models to predict target times for upcoming runs.
The project aims to assist runners in setting achievable goals by incorporating factors such as previous performance, weather, and event characteristics.

## Project Features
- **Data Collection:** Scrapes historical and real-time data from parkrun websites.
- **Weather Integration:** Fetches weather data (temperature, wind speed, precipitation) using the Open Meteo API.
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Processes raw data to remove outliers, calculate metrics, and generate supplementary data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Trains models to predict future run times based on features like PB time, average run time, age, gender, weather, etc.
- **Visualization:** Generates charts and graphs to track trends and highlight key insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, time, scikit-learn, pickle, random, xgboost, optuna
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Open Meteo API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Anaconda (recommended) or a virtual environment
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `pickle`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `seaborn`, `random`, `time`, `optuna`, `random`, `xgboost`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/owen-george/parkrun_analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd parkrun_analysis
   ```
3. Install required libraries


### Usage
1. **Run Notebooks in Order:**
   - Notebooks are numbered sequentially. Start with `1_scrape_and_load.ipynb` to collect raw parkrun data.
   - Each notebook builds on the previous one, but you can skip directly to `5_Predictor.ipynb` to use the pre-trained model for predictions, which is trained on data from the Brighton parkrun up to 2024-12-07.

2. **Example Command:**
   - Use the default settings in `1_scrape_and_load.ipynb` to scrape Brighton parkrun data (events 1â€“826).
   - Add weather data using `2_add_weather.ipynb`.
   - Clean and process the data using `3_clean_and_filter.ipynb`
   - Train a model in `4_ML_time_index.ipynb`
   - Use the model to get your target in `5_Predictor.ipynb`.


### File Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains raw and cleaned parkrun data.
  - `raw/`: Unprocessed CSV files.
  - `clean/`: Data ready for analysis.
- **`EDA/`**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) results, including supplementary figures and tables.
- **`functions/`**: Python modules for data scraping, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **`models/`**: Contains pickled machine learning models and scalers.
- **`figures/`**: Visualizations generated from analysis and modeling.

### Notebooks Overview
1. **`1_scrape_and_load.ipynb`:** Scrapes parkrun data and exports it as a CSV file.
2. **`2_add_weather.ipynb`:** Integrates weather data with the parkrun data.
3. **`3_clean_and_filter.ipynb`:** Cleans, filters, and formats the data.
4. **`4_ML_time_index.ipynb`:** Trains machine learning models to predict target run times.
5. **`5_Predictor.ipynb`:** Predicts the target time for the next parkrun using the pre-trained model.

### Outputs
- Predicted target time for the next parkrun based on key features.
- Cleaned datasets for runners and events.
- Visualizations (e.g., performance trends, weather impacts).
